You can now create a FlowCollector resource. A very short FlowCollector should work, using default values, plus with the standalone console enabled:

apiVersion: flows.netobserv.io/v1beta2
kind: FlowCollector
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  namespace: netobserv
  consolePlugin:
    advanced:
      env:
        TEST_CONSOLE: "true"
  prometheus:
    querier:
      manual:
        url: http://prometheus:9090


A few remarks:
While the web console is primarily designed as a plugin for the OpenShift Console, it is still possible to deploy it as a standalone, which the dev team sometimes use for testing. This is why it is mentioned as "TEST_CONSOLE" here.
If you're in OpenShift, you should omit "TEST_CONSOLE: true" to use the Console plugin instead, which offers a better / more integrated experience.
You can change the Prometheus URL depending on your installation. This example URL works if you use the make deploy-prometheus script from the repository. Prometheus configuration options are documented here.
To view the test console, you can port-forward 9001:

kubectl port-forward svc/netobserv-plugin 9001:9001 -n netobserv

Then open http://localhost:9001/ in your browser.
